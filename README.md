Project pageserver for CIS 399se (CIS322) 

### What to look for ###

* You can find the working version of the code under the name of "pageserve.py"
  * There is an empty file called omar.img for testing the server
* My Username on the ix server is "oka", the folder can be located at `ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~oka/public_html/cis399se/httbin/proj-pageserver/`


#### extra feature ####
I have printed all the errors to the server console, becuase why not. It is just something I wanted to leave after debugging, it is a nice debugging tool.
